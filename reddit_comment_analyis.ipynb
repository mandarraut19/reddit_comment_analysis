       "'##Start File## Coming out October 8: new FIFA 22! PEGI 12!  Coming out October 9: free optional DLC game mode Ultimate Team This is the type of legislation that I can get with.  It’s a nuanced approach that both respects an adults choices, but makes sure that children aren’t terribly exposed to this content without parental consent and even implements a method to ensure that parents aren’t alone in essentially monitoring what their kids experience.  I feel like if this kind of ruling occurred in the US, it would be much more heavy handed. Obviously, how this appears on paper may change when it’s properly implemented, but it looks good to me right now Taken from [spiegel.de](https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/regierung-will-kinder-vor-kostenfallen-beim-gaming-schuetzen-a-5dd1781c-c458-4165-a571-b0dcbe72ba3a) :\"With a reform of the Youth Protection Act, the government wants to ensure that children do not come into contact with incentives to buy in video games. The Bundestag passed the amendment on Friday. The Ministry of Family Affairs had initiated the reform of the almost 20-year-old law.  For video game developers, this could have far-reaching consequences. With the reform, so-called loot boxes, i.e. paid content in games that unlock virtual clothing, weapons and equipment, will be targeted by the youth protection authorities. The law speaks of \"risks through gambling-like mechanisms\". Accordingly, such purchase options could be classified as impairing the development of children and young people - and thus affect the age rating.  According to lawyer Julia Maris, the law will have an impact on age restrictions. \"Online games or other applications that use lootboxes or similar in-game offers would probably be classified with an age rating of 18 or older,\" Maris tells SPIEGEL.  The reform would thus also affect games that were previously classified as harmless, such as \"Fifa 21\". The football simulation is currently approved without age restriction by the Prüfstelle Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle. But since the collector\\'s mode \"Ultimate Team\" offers card sets for purchase by default, this could change. In order for video games to receive an age rating for children, loot boxes would have to be deactivated by default.  Among other things, children should be protected from being ripped off with age-appropriate default settings, but also with warning pictograms before purchase. \"We want clear symbols that point out risks such as depictions of violence or cost traps,\" said SPD Family Minister Franziska Giffey.  In a statement, the video game association Game says that it takes its responsibility for the protection of minors particularly seriously. According to Managing Director Felix Falk, it remains \"a matter of course to offer and further develop modern and functioning solutions for the protection of minors\".  The new law is to be adapted to the digital age and thus no longer differentiates, for example, whether videos and games are started on a console, mobile phone or PC. It also does not matter whether the data is downloaded from a DVD or from the internet. The previous version still referred to video cassettes, among other things.  Lawyer Julia Maris considers the reform necessary. \"The law provides for changes that are basically to be welcomed.\" It is \"indeed the case that children and young people are currently not sufficiently protected on the internet\". Online companies would now be obliged to introduce uniform age labels and to provide assistance. \"There are immense fines to be paid if the requirement is violated,\" says Maris.  Protection against harmful online content  The law still has to be approved by the Bundesrat and is expected to come into force this spring. In addition to protection against cost traps, it provides that children and young people must be protected from harassment on online platforms. Social networks must prevent children and young people from being found, contacted and harassed by strangers. So-called cybergrooming is to be combated. Adults often stalk minors in chats under false identities, often with the aim of meeting them in real life and abusing them.  Facebook told SPIEGEL on Friday: \"The safety of young people on Facebook and Instagram is our top priority.\" It does not allow any content or behaviour \"that endangers the privacy and safety of minors\". The company removes content that violates the guidelines as soon as it is found, he said. \"We continue to evolve our products to ensure the safety of young people.\" Facebook also refers to the statement of the industry association Bitkom. Among other things, it says there that it expressly supports the goal of the Federal Government to protect children and young people from harmful online content.  Industry association criticises unclear regulations  Bitkom managing director Susanne Dehmel criticises that it could now become even more confusing to find out which law applies and which authority is responsible. \"The new regulations rely on unclear definitions and legal terms and lead to overlapping, if not contradictory, duties and supervisory structures with other laws,\" says Dehmel.  The problem: State media authorities are actually responsible for monitoring the protection of minors on the internet. But to the displeasure of the state authorities (PDF), the Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Young People is to be upgraded to the Federal Centre for the Protection of Children and Young People in the Media. Among other things, the authority is to impose fines for violations of the law.  The critics also lack a clear demarcation from existing regulations such as the Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors from Harmful Media, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the right of complaint of the NetzDG and the Telemedia Act That\\'s a great idea, but I feel like EA and Activision would simply find work-arounds. For example, they could say that the loot boxes in Ultimate Team are only exclusively purchase-able with in-game currency and not real money, so they\\'re not \"paid content\", but at the same time let you buy in-game currency with real money. Not to be contrarian, but dont the packs of cards in CCGs also constitute gambling mechanics? Are they going to ban them too? Or restrict them to 18+ ? As a german, this is a good idea on paper in my opinion, but knowing the german government this will be a stepping stone into more hardcore legislations, something along the lines of \"point your ID into a camera before buying an 18+ game on steam\" while completely violating your personal privacy (This is actually already being rolled out for 18+ youtube videos in various EU countries), for this reason I\\'m not a big fan of it. If they don\\'t leverage this into more draconian measures then good, but I think they will. The \"SPD\" (Social Democratic Party of Germany) already put the idea that accounts in german internet forums should be tied to a real name to prevent hatecrime or something like that in their election program. Good, but the problem is that Age-Verification is really not a thing online. Valve banned ALL Adult-Only Games on Steam in Germany. They refuse to implement a Age-Verification System and rather just block the Games for Germans.  So Steam would probably rather ban all Games with Lootboxes in Germany instead of putting a Age-Verification System in place. What about games that add microtransactions N months after release? (CoD MW) Having read the article, I remain sceptical. Our governments history of execution of regulating online media has been unimpressive thus far, as has the general understanding of how online media works.  An example for this is the infamous Article 13, a law that would strengthen copyright law. The government claimed there would be no automatic filters necessary, despite experts from all corners saying the opposite. Lo and behold, now the government conceded that filters would indeed be necessary.  If this set of laws is achieved through a similar level of competence, then chances are it is either going to be completely without consequence or affect games that do not partake in predatory practises. It\\'s a super theory in practice which shouldn\\'t even require a law... but knowing parents, it won\\'t matter anyway. Parents buy GTA to their children and I\\'ve never seen a store deny a purchase on age alone (read, the kids take GTA5, goes to the counter, clerks says no obviously, but parent buys it) unless it\\'s way different in Europe.  So let\\'s say FIFA continues their HUT trend... even if FIFA is now marked 18, do you honestly believe parents won\\'t buy a simple soccer game for their kids? ~~Same for Fortnite~~? Kid walks up to counter with Lootbox Game  Cashier: Hey kid I can\\'t sell you this game Kid: Hey mom can I buy this? Mom: Yeah, sure, whatever Cashier: That\\'ll be 59.99 How about parents make sure their kids don\\'t spend thousands of $$ on video game ? It really isn\\'t that hard... It\\'s a good thing to pump up the rating but in the big picture how does it help? kids get parents to buy stuff always anyway. I mean was a kid of 9 running to the store to buy FIFA anyway?  >the government wants to ensure that children do not come into contact with incentives to buy in video games  Well it doesn\\'t ensure anything. Lol Steam. Origins and all others. You can buy without verification. Only thing is Blizzard. I think they do have verification but only if parents want.  Good part: Sony and XBOX will be locking those finally out. They have age verification. All hardcopies except for those sold second hand (like ebay) will be hard to track and verify. Except for that it should hit the playerbase of especially FiFa hard af. We need Lootbox laws that force developers to be more transparent and show the rates of every winnable item. How does this stop kids buying the game online via their console or Steam account? There are plenty of kids playing GTA or COD online which already are rated 18+ Yes! Protect minors from exploitative game mechanics.  No! Don\\'t make it impossible for adults to buy adult games without having to give up your ID or other barriers.  How can we solve that dilemma? Protection for minors / Don\\'t make it too hard for adults? As expected Belgium and The Netherlands the warning shots for big companies to get ready for their big neighbors to follow nice. now the same parents who didnt pay attention to thier kids using thier credit cards can not pay attention to the 18+ game rating Keyword here is \"Sold\"  This wont affect free 2 play mobile game Gachas. Since you have to be essentially 18 to link a card to purchase on there in the first place. How would this affect f2p games that have lootboxes? Most of the popular games out right now have moved over to battle passes that require you to play the game like it\\'s a job. This is just an example of governments being behind. This is stupid. It’s not the job of developers to prevent kids from buying loot-boxes, it’s parents. However you feel about the system, games shouldn’t be regulated to this extent. I hope one day these laws extend to random chance gambling toys and card games (Magic the Gathering, Yugioh, Pokemon, etc.) that target minors and the weak willed. I dont get why people are so obsessed about kids being exposed to gambling as if theyve never grown up and practically invented gambling with friends themselves. I grew up getting scratch off tickets, shit was fun. We need to do better about teaching reaponsible gambling, sure, but trying to just ban it and heavily restrict it just leads to unregulated grey and black markets. Also the stock market, but i guess that falls under a poorly regulated grey market. I find it funny how LITTLE my own government is communicating about this.  I wasn\\'t even aware anything like this had reached the parliament. And I am even more surprised if even GOT there in the first place, considering how BAD they are out of touch. Will they by-pass this by instead selling a minuscule item that comes with loot box as a bonus? German Government: We want to protekt ze children from falling into money pits due to gambling-like mechanics.  EA Lawers: Good! So Fifa can continue as before. Since UT offers absolutely ***nothing*** of value it is not gambling-like (\\\\* high-fives in the background) The law should include currency that can be purchased with real money too,or just outright ban lootboxes in under pg 18 games. Then i would have liked the brussel effect to do its part. That feel when in America mature games have similar standards but I see 10 year olds calling me a newb in every COD lobby. I think it\\'s enough to rate the games 18+. That\\'ll scare most parents. straight up banning the sale unless you have 18+ ID is a shitty rule. I 100% support this decision and wish it were worldwide. I see how terribly effective lootbox mechanics are with my 7yr old daughter and do my best to steer her away from games that include it. So this doesn’t effect f2p games like csgo and dota? Does gacha count? Game ratings really doesn’t matter. Do you think parents won’t buy their kids the newest FIFA because there’s an 18 sticker on it? So you cant download a game on Android or Apple or Steam in Germany that has lootboxes?  Im sure thats enforced right? Finally somebody is doing something about it. But this was in the air for a long time, that\\'s why most games now have just Battle pass and no more loot boxes. EA probably just wanted to milk the cow till the end. Maybe the next year FUT will be redone. I hope at least. EA should just call their bluff and make FIFA 18+. They would still sell millions and make the whole rating system look as stupid as it is. *laughs in parents buying 18+ games for their pre-teens and early teens since digital games were conceived* >* Shops will check your ID or the postal service will check your ID if you buy online  Does every postal service know what\\'s inside the package? Do they open them?  This will also do nothing but make kids beg their parents to buy it for them, same way kids get GTA V. I wish my lawmakers would take more notes from contemporary Germans. Instead it seems both sides are trying to emulate the Weimar Republic. Does Germany have many physical stores for video games? I don\\'t see the age enforcement mattering for online purchases. This is great for the games that still have initial purchases (CoD, Fifa, etc) but a large percentage of games with lootbox mechanics, like Fortnight, Apex Legends, Genshin Impact, etc are all Free-to-Play.  So no-one is \"selling\" these games to kids. I’ve worked on internet content filters for my company for years and I always wondered what German youth protection was. The definitions I saw always included nazi youth and stuff like that. This definition is really odd. This should be the case everywhere. If you have lootboxes or other forms of infinite monetisation then you should have your game rated 18+ and along with that, be banned from advertising in the media. I can’t wait for exp boosters and online passes to make a return. If people think that this is going to stop companies for putting manipulative micro transactions in their games they have another thing coming.  I can see EA adding a battle pass like system to their sports games. Games aren\\'t really sold to minors anyway. They\\'re usually sold to the parents who then give them to the kids. I\\'m guessing anything other than an outright ban will stop kids just as much as it stops them from saying they are over 18 to view porn sites. If they follow it up with a law that makes it ilegal to sell lootboxes to underage kids, then lootboxes become a permanently refundable mechanic if you don\\'t get what you want.  And the companies can no longer find a way around it when selling the game means accepting that users can just decide they didn\\'t like their lootbox pulls and refund the lootboxes and the game.  I love the idea, but they\\'ll just not list the lootboxes on German store pages and let the users buy them anyway. Or shit, they way things have gone they\\'ll insert them directly into the console stores not attached to their games somehow. (The infrastructure\\'s already there, you can give google play a bunch of money and then go buy things in multiple apps. Throw that on Xbox and you just created the xbox lootbox store.) \"Mom can you buy this game for me?\"  This is the oldest most useless form of child control over devised for a video game. As much as this is a good thing against assholes like EA this is kinda not a good thing for anyone else. Like there’s nothing evil or predatory about Overwatch loot boxes, and this will fuck with its sales I assume this will just mean games with loot boxes will just have a higher content rating/age? what about f2p games, like Hearthstone with all those card pack? Or even Path of Exile with their mystery boxes, where some people sink $400 without completing a skin set, while getting many dupes of most common parts)..  What about online digital purchases? Like steam, where you charge wallet with gift cards and you can buy whatever you please.. I mean even on consoles digital sales start to physical ones - there\\'s no one checking ID there. So is Magic: The Gathering now an 18+ game in Germanyt? ...Just ban the lootboxes? Why? Why restrict it? As someone who worked in video game retail (throughout my college and uni years), customers will find a way.  It\\'ll likely be via a \"this game has lootboxes, and should not be played by users under (insert age here)\", buried in the EULA. The post office will check IDs? On delivery? That doesn’t make much sense? How do they know what’s in the box? What about digital downloads? Can‘t everyone in Germany buy FSK 18 games on Steam or the PS Store? So you just have to buy a gift card and then buy the game online. Won\\'t games just patch them in after the game launches then? Any kind of age rating is bullshit anyway. Children are likely never going to pay for games, so why even bother with this bullshit? Do you think parents care that a 7 year old is going to play GTA? Maybe if a parent is a gamer, maybe they might think it is too soon, but nothing will stop teenagers. They will find a way, just like how porn ends up at the hands of teenagers regardless of it being 18+.  It is futile legislation with even bigger futile intent. Politicians again showing how ignorant they and out of touch from reality they truly are. There is no law that is useful in protecting children. It is all PR show and adds nothing of value. Only people that can protect children are the goddamn parents. It is their job and only their job. If they suck, so they will fail and kid will get rekt by reality of our society. http://dipbt.bundestag.de/extrakt/ba/WP19/2685/268540.html  Here is the actual source of the actual document. Only in german though  https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2021/kw09-de-jugendschutzgesetz-825814 Does this mean fortnite could be rated 18+? Does this applies to genshin? I would love the sweating of EA to either turn off ultimate team or rate their game where minors cant play. Good more countries should follow suit. It really does enforce bad habits on children and kids have enough to deal with without an addiction like gambling or the fear of missing out Finally! This is good news! // For context: This September national elections take place in Germany. The SPD (responsible for the ministry of family that brought this new law forward) is badly trailing in the polls. Not to discredit it, just to give context for international redditors.  ##End File##'"

In addition to protection against cost traps, it provides that children and young people must be protected from harassment on online platforms. Social networks must prevent children and young people from being found, contacted and harassed by strangers. So-called cybergrooming is to be combated. Adults often stalk minors in chats under false identities, often with the aim of meeting them in real life and abusing them.  Facebook told SPIEGEL on Friday: \"The safety of young people on Facebook and Instagram is our top priority.\" It does not allow any content or behaviour \"that endangers the privacy and safety of minors\". The company removes content that violates the guidelines as soon as it is found, he said. \"We continue to evolve our products to ensure the safety of young people.\" Facebook also refers to the statement of the industry association Bitkom. Among other things, it says there that it expressly supports the goal of the Federal Government to protect children and young people from harmful online content.  Industry association criticises unclear regulations  Bitkom managing director Susanne Dehmel criticises that it could now become even more confusing to find out which law applies and which authority is responsible. \"The new regulations rely on unclear definitions and legal terms and lead to overlapping, if not contradictory, duties and supervisory structures with other laws,\" says Dehmel.  The problem: State media authorities are actually responsible for monitoring the protection of minors on the internet. But to the displeasure of the state authorities (PDF), the Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Young People is to be upgraded to the Federal Centre for the Protection of Children and Young People in the Media. Among other things, the authority is to impose fines for violations of the law.  The critics also lack a clear demarcation from existing regulations such as the Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors from Harmful Media, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the right of complaint of the NetzDG and the Telemedia Act That's a great idea, but I feel like EA and Activision would simply find work-arounds. For example, they could say that the loot boxes in Ultimate Team are only exclusively purchase-able with in-game currency and not real money, so they're not \"paid content\", but at the same time let you buy in-game currency with real money. Not to be contrarian, but dont the packs of cards in CCGs also constitute gambling mechanics? Are they going to ban them too? Or restrict them to 18+ ? As a german, this is a good idea on paper in my opinion, but knowing the german government this will be a stepping stone into more hardcore legislations, something along the lines of \"point your ID into a camera before buying an 18+ game on steam\" while completely violating your personal privacy (This is actually already being rolled out for 18+ youtube videos in various EU countries), for this reason I'm not a big fan of it. If they don't leverage this into more draconian measures then good, but I think they will. The \"SPD\" (Social Democratic Party of Germany) already put the idea that accounts in german internet forums should be tied to a real name to prevent hatecrime or something like that in their election program. Good, but the problem is that Age-Verification is really not a thing online. Valve banned ALL Adult-Only Games on Steam in Germany. They refuse to implement a Age-Verification System and rather just block the Games for Germans.  So Steam would probably rather ban all Games with Lootboxes in Germany instead of putting a Age-Verification System in place. What about games that add microtransactions N months after release? (CoD MW) Having read the article, I remain sceptical. Our governments history of execution of regulating online media has been unimpressive thus far, as has the general understanding of how online media works.  An example for this is the infamous Article 13, a law that would strengthen copyright law. The government claimed there would be no automatic filters necessary, despite experts from all corners saying the opposite. Lo and behold, now the government conceded that filters would indeed be necessary.  If this set of laws is achieved through a similar level of competence, then chances are it is either going to be completely without consequence or affect games that do not partake in predatory practises. It's a super theory in practice which shouldn't even require a law... but knowing parents, it won't matter anyway. Parents buy GTA to their children and I've never seen a store deny a purchase on age alone (read, the kids take GTA5, goes to the counter, clerks says no obviously, but parent buys it) unless it's way different in Europe.  So let's say FIFA continues their HUT trend... even if FIFA is now marked 18, do you honestly believe parents won't buy a simple soccer game for their kids? ~~Same for Fortnite~~? Kid walks up to counter with Lootbox Game  Cashier: Hey kid I can't sell you this game Kid: Hey mom can I buy this? Mom: Yeah, sure, whatever Cashier: That'll be 59.99 How about parents make sure their kids don't spend thousands of $$ on video game ? It really isn't that hard... It's a good thing to pump up the rating but in the big picture how does it help? kids get parents to buy stuff always anyway. I mean was a kid of 9 running to the store to buy FIFA anyway?  >the government wants to ensure that children do not come into contact with incentives to buy in video games  Well it doesn't ensure anything. Lol Steam. Origins and all others. You can buy without verification. Only thing is Blizzard. I think they do have verification but only if parents want.  Good part: Sony and XBOX will be locking those finally out. They have age verification. All hardcopies except for those sold second hand (like ebay) will be hard to track and verify. Except for that it should hit the playerbase of especially FiFa hard af. We need Lootbox laws that force developers to be more transparent and show the rates of every winnable item. How does this stop kids buying the game online via their console or Steam account? There are plenty of kids playing GTA or COD online which already are rated 18+ Yes! Protect minors from exploitative game mechanics.  No! Don't make it impossible for adults to buy adult games without having to give up your ID or other barriers.  How can we solve that dilemma? Protection for minors / Don't make it too hard for adults? As expected Belgium and The Netherlands the warning shots for big companies to get ready for their big neighbors to follow nice. now the same parents who didnt pay attention to thier kids using thier credit cards can not pay attention to the 18+ game rating Keyword here is \"Sold\"  This wont affect free 2 play mobile game Gachas. Since you have to be essentially 18 to link a card to purchase on there in the first place. How would this affect f2p games that have lootboxes? Most of the popular games out right now have moved over to battle passes that require you to play the game like it's a job. This is just an example of governments being behind. This is stupid. It’s not the job of developers to prevent kids from buying loot-boxes, it’s parents. However you feel about the system, games shouldn’t be regulated to this extent. I hope one day these laws extend to random chance gambling toys and card games (Magic the Gathering, Yugioh, Pokemon, etc.) that target minors and the weak willed. I dont get why people are so obsessed about kids being exposed to gambling as if theyve never grown up and practically invented gambling with friends themselves. I grew up getting scratch off tickets, shit was fun. We need to do better about teaching reaponsible gambling, sure, but trying to just ban it and heavily restrict it just leads to unregulated grey and black markets. Also the stock market, but i guess that falls under a poorly regulated grey market. I find it funny how LITTLE my own government is communicating about this.  I wasn't even aware anything like this had reached the parliament. And I am even more surprised if even GOT there in the first place, considering how BAD they are out of touch. Will they by-pass this by instead selling a minuscule item that comes with loot box as a bonus? German Government: We want to protekt ze children from falling into money pits due to gambling-like mechanics.  EA Lawers: Good! So Fifa can continue as before. Since UT offers absolutely ***nothing*** of value it is not gambling-like (\\* high-fives in the background) The law should include currency that can be purchased with real money too,or just outright ban lootboxes in under pg 18 games. Then i would have liked the brussel effect to do its part. That feel when in America mature games have similar standards but I see 10 year olds calling me a newb in every COD lobby. I think it's enough to rate the games 18+. That'll scare most parents. straight up banning the sale unless you have 18+ ID is a shitty rule. I 100% support this decision and wish it were worldwide. I see how terribly effective lootbox mechanics are with my 7yr old daughter and do my best to steer her away from games that include it. So this doesn’t effect f2p games like csgo and dota? Does gacha count? Game ratings really doesn’t matter. Do you think parents won’t buy their kids the newest FIFA because there’s an 18 sticker on it? So you cant download a game on Android or Apple or Steam in Germany that has lootboxes?  Im sure thats enforced right? Finally somebody is doing something about it. But this was in the air for a long time, that's why most games now have just Battle pass and no more loot boxes. EA probably just wanted to milk the cow till the end. Maybe the next year FUT will be redone. I hope at least. EA should just call their bluff and make FIFA 18+. They would still sell millions and make the whole rating system look as stupid as it is. *laughs in parents buying 18+ games for their pre-teens and early teens since digital games were conceived* >* Shops will check your ID or the postal service will check your ID if you buy online  Does every postal service know what's inside the package? Do they open them?  This will also do nothing but make kids beg their parents to buy it for them, same way kids get GTA V. I wish my lawmakers would take more notes from contemporary Germans. Instead it seems both sides are trying to emulate the Weimar Republic. Does Germany have many physical stores for video games? I don't see the age enforcement mattering for online purchases. This is great for the games that still have initial purchases (CoD, Fifa, etc) but a large percentage of games with lootbox mechanics, like Fortnight, Apex Legends, Genshin Impact, etc are all Free-to-Play.  So no-one is \"selling\" these games to kids. I’ve worked on internet content filters for my company for years and I always wondered what German youth protection was. The definitions I saw always included nazi youth and stuff like that. This definition is really odd. This should be the case everywhere. If you have lootboxes or other forms of infinite monetisation then you should have your game rated 18+ and along with that, be banned from advertising in the media. I can’t wait for exp boosters and online passes to make a return. If people think that this is going to stop companies for putting manipulative micro transactions in their games they have another thing coming.  I can see EA adding a battle pass like system to their sports games. Games aren't really sold to minors anyway. They're usually sold to the parents who then give them to the kids. I'm guessing anything other than an outright ban will stop kids just as much as it stops them from saying they are over 18 to view porn sites. If they follow it up with a law that makes it ilegal to sell lootboxes to underage kids, then lootboxes become a permanently refundable mechanic if you don't get what you want.  And the companies can no longer find a way around it when selling the game means accepting that users can just decide they didn't like their lootbox pulls and refund the lootboxes and the game.  I love the idea, but they'll just not list the lootboxes on German store pages and let the users buy them anyway. Or shit, they way things have gone they'll insert them directly into the console stores not attached to their games somehow. (The infrastructure's already there, you can give google play a bunch of money and then go buy things in multiple apps. Throw that on Xbox and you just created the xbox lootbox store.) \"Mom can you buy this game for me?\"  This is the oldest most useless form of child control over devised for a video game. As much as this is a good thing against assholes like EA this is kinda not a good thing for anyone else. Like there’s nothing evil or predatory about Overwatch loot boxes, and this will fuck with its sales I assume this will just mean games with loot boxes will just have a higher content rating/age? what about f2p games, like Hearthstone with all those card pack? Or even Path of Exile with their mystery boxes, where some people sink $400 without completing a skin set, while getting many dupes of most common parts)..  What about online digital purchases? Like steam, where you charge wallet with gift cards and you can buy whatever you please.. I mean even on consoles digital sales start to physical ones - there's no one checking ID there. So is Magic: The Gathering now an 18+ game in Germanyt? ...Just ban the lootboxes? Why? Why restrict it? As someone who worked in video game retail (throughout my college and uni years), customers will find a way.  It'll likely be via a \"this game has lootboxes, and should not be played by users under (insert age here)\", buried in the EULA. The post office will check IDs? On delivery? That doesn’t make much sense? How do they know what’s in the box? What about digital downloads? Can‘t everyone in Germany buy FSK 18 games on Steam or the PS Store? So you just have to buy a gift card and then buy the game online. Won't games just patch them in after the game launches then? Any kind of age rating is bullshit anyway. Children are likely never going to pay for games, so why even bother with this bullshit? Do you think parents care that a 7 year old is going to play GTA? Maybe if a parent is a gamer, maybe they might think it is too soon, but nothing will stop teenagers. They will find a way, just like how porn ends up at the hands of teenagers regardless of it being 18+.  It is futile legislation with even bigger futile intent. Politicians again showing how ignorant they and out of touch from reality they truly are. There is no law that is useful in protecting children. It is all PR show and adds nothing of value. Only people that can protect children are the goddamn parents. It is their job and only their job. If they suck, so they will fail and kid will get rekt by reality of our society. http://dipbt.bundestag.de/extrakt/ba/WP19/2685/268540.html  Here is the actual source of the actual document. Only in german though  https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2021/kw09-de-jugendschutzgesetz-825814 Does this mean fortnite could be rated 18+? Does this applies to genshin? I would love the sweating of EA to either turn off ultimate team or rate their game where minors cant play. Good more countries should follow suit. It really does enforce bad habits on children and kids have enough to deal with without an addiction like gambling or the fear of missing out Finally! This is good news! // For context: This September national elections take place in Germany. The SPD (responsible for the ministry of family that brought this new law forward) is badly trailing in the polls. Not to discredit it, just to give context for international redditors.  \n"
