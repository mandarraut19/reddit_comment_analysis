This is a small code for Post-Subject prediction of subreddits with the help of the user comments.

The code is divided in two parts:
1) Creating a corpus file for the post with the highest upvote ratio.
2) Creating a corpus file for the comment section for the upvoted post.

By calculating the lexical diversity and the frequency distribution of the comment courpus file, we can predict, rough idea but not accurate, subject of the post.
